# Now you can tell Lambskin he's wrong, automatically.

## Requirements:

`nodejs`

A Discord account or your User Token. Self-botting is technically against the ToS but for what we're doing it's not API Abuse so whatever.


## Setup

[Get Your Account Token](https://discordhelp.net/discord-token) and don't give it to anyone.

Add your account token between the "" in `config.json`


## Usage 

Open a CLI in the directory and Run:

`node main.js` 

Now you don't have to bother looking at what Lambskin actually said.
